# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption (Python)

This project is a simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, a basic encryption technique that shifts letters in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

---

## 📌 About the Project
The program takes user input text and a shift key (0–25) and encrypts the message by shifting each alphabetic character forward. Uppercase and lowercase letters are handled separately, while numbers, spaces, and punctuation remain unchanged.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Functions
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- ASCII conversion (`ord()` and `chr()`)

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
